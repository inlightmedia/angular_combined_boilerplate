This project is not working yet. I'm trying to find the best way of structuring my angular code and I like the components folder method but I want to use the components folder as my src folder and compile to the public folder, so I'm taking a course on gulp to aid with this. This project is a mix of a regular angularJS project using $scope and one with the components structure using vm.variable scoping. 

Don't mind the mess. As I get time I'll be fixing the code and getting them looking better and actually working!

You may notice that the project is not using the public folder yet. It's using the root currently but I hope to compile the components folder contents to a build or dist folder that is publicly accessible.
